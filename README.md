# Dodge-the-Sugars

In this JavaScript-based game, players will embark on a delicious journey where they earn health points by catching non-sugary foods and risk losing health points by catching sugary treats.

# Gameplay
In this game, players control a smiley face character by clicking and dragging it across the screen. The objective is to maintain health points above zero by avoiding sugary foods and catching non-sugary ones before the timer runs out. Players can choose from various difficulty levels that adjust the speed of the moving food items. Health points are displayed at the top of the screen, and catching non-sugary foods replenishes them, while colliding with sugary foods reduces them.

# Technologies used
-	Javascript was used to run the game mechanics
-	HTML & CSS were used to design the website

# Challenges & Key Learnings

The difficulty encountered in constructing this JavaScript game arose from its length and disorderliness. To address this issue, I implemented utility functions to streamline repetitive code segments and organized lengthy code blocks into separate functions (e.g. createSugars, handleGameover, countdown).

To navigate unfamiliar JavaScript functions like incorporating mouse events and progress bars, I tackled the challenge by conducting research online and experimenting with trial and error within my own code.

Rather than hardcoding values directly into functions, I stored them as variables, allowing for easier adjustments to align with the game's mechanics. 

# Next steps
Planned future enhancements
-	Add a countdown for the game to start
-	Make the game more interactive by adding sounds for collisions
-	Keep a scoreboard for win/lose states
